.. module:: photoeccentric

The core classes within ``photoeccentric`` are the ``KeplerStar`` and ``KOI`` classes. After creating  a ``photoeccentric.KeplerStar`` object with information about the host star of a KOI system,
you will be able to create a ``photoeccentric.KOI`` object for each planet you wish to investigate. This ``photoeccentric.KOI`` object will 

When creating a ``juliet.load`` object, the returned object will be able to call a
``fit`` function which in turn returns a ``juliet.fit`` object, which saves all the information about the fit (results statistics, posteriors, model evaluations,
etc.) --- these classes are explained in detail below:

.. autoclass:: juliet.load
   :members:

.. autoclass:: juliet.fit
   :members:

The returned ``fit`` object, in turn, also has other objects inherted in it. In particular, if ``results`` is a ``juliet.fit`` object, ``results.lc`` and ``results.rv``
are ``juliet.model`` objects that host all the details about the dataset being modelled. This follows the model definition outlined in Section 2 of the
`juliet paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08549>`_:

.. autoclass:: juliet.model
   :members:

Finally, the ``juliet.load`` object also contains a dictionary (``juliet.load.lc_options`` for lightcurves and ``juliet.load.rv_options`` for radial-velocities)
which holds, if a gaussian-process is being used to model the noise, a ``juliet.gaussian_process`` object. This class handles everything related to the gaussian-processes,
from model and parameter names/values, to log-likelihood evaluations. This class is defined below:

.. autoclass:: juliet.gaussian_process

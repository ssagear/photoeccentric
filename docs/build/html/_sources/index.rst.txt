   This project is under active development!

photoeccentric is a transit light curve analysis tool for eccentric transiting systems.
It allows you to get individual eccentricity posterior distributions for transiting exoplanets using Kepler light curves and stellar density priors.

photoeccentric currently supports Kepler short- and long-cadence data. Support for K2 and TESS data coming soon. Check out the Installation instructions and Getting Started!
